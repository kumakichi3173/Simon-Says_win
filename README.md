# Simon-Says

About this program

- Color memory game
- There are 4 different colored buttons
- each button has a light 
- each button has a different sound
- Simon talks by playing a note and light up a button, and then a user talks back by pressing the same button (light & sound)
- If the user doesn't follow the sequences (if the user doesn't follow what Simon says), it's game over
